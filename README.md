#React Django Blog

Simple blogging platform build with React on the frontend and Django Rest Framework on the backend.

Users can:
* Sign up, login
* View a feed of all posts
* Add, update, and delete their own posts
* Navigate to invidiual pages for each post
* Navigate to profiles for each user


I used this project to teach myself the basics of React. Some features of React that I explored during this project include:
* Passing props between components
* Using data from a REST API
* React hooks: useEffect, useState
* Context API
* Cookies
* React Router
* Conditional views and permissions 
* Conditional routing
